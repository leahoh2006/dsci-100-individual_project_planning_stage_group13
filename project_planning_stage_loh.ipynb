More specifically, I want to explore whether the **age** and their **total time played** of a player can predict whether the player is subscribed to the game-related newsletter.  \n",

The two predictors I plan to use are age (integer) and played_hours (dbt) which each contain 196 observations each. These predictors will allow us to observe whether they have an impact if a player is subscribed to the game-related newsletter. \n",
